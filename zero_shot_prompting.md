# Zero-Shot Prompting Implementation for Pneumonia Detection

## Overview
This implementation demonstrates zero-shot prompting in the context of AI-powered pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. Zero-shot prompting allows the AI model to perform tasks without any specific examples or training data for that particular task.

## What is Zero-Shot Prompting?

Zero-shot prompting is a technique where we provide the AI model with a task description and ask it to perform the task without giving it any examples. The model relies on its pre-trained knowledge to understand and execute the task.

### Key Characteristics:
- **No Examples**: No training examples or demonstrations provided
- **Task Description**: Clear instruction about what needs to be done
- **Reliance on Pre-training**: Model uses knowledge gained during training
- **Immediate Application**: Can be applied to new tasks without fine-tuning

## Implementation in Pneumonia Detection

### Zero-Shot Prompt Design

```javascript
const zeroShotPrompt = `
Analyze this chest X-ray image for signs of pneumonia. 

Your task is to:
1. Examine the lung fields for any abnormalities
2. Look for signs of consolidation, opacity, or fluid accumulation
3. Assess the overall lung health
4. Provide a diagnosis: "Pneumonia detected" or "No pneumonia detected"
5. Include a confidence score (0-100%)
6. Explain your reasoning

Provide your response in this exact format:
DIAGNOSIS: [Pneumonia detected/No pneumonia detected]
CONFIDENCE: [0-100]%
REASONING: [Your detailed explanation of findings]
KEY_FINDINGS: [List specific abnormalities or normal findings]
`;
```

### Why This Works as Zero-Shot:

1. **No Medical Examples**: We don't provide example X-rays or diagnoses
2. **Clear Task Definition**: The prompt clearly states what to analyze and how to respond
3. **Structured Output**: Requests specific format without showing examples
4. **Relies on Training**: Uses the model's pre-trained medical knowledge

### Advanced Zero-Shot Implementation

```javascript
const advancedZeroShotPrompt = `
You are a radiologist analyzing a chest X-ray for pneumonia detection.

TASK: Perform a comprehensive analysis of this chest X-ray image to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia.

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Examine bilateral lung fields systematically
- Assess for consolidation patterns
- Look for air bronchograms
- Evaluate pleural spaces
- Check for signs of inflammation or infection

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "diagnosis": "pneumonia_detected" | "no_pneumonia_detected",
  "confidence_percentage": number,
  "findings": {
    "left_lung": "description",
    "right_lung": "description",
    "consolidation_present": boolean,
    "air_bronchograms": boolean,
    "pleural_effusion": boolean
  },
  "clinical_impression": "detailed explanation",
  "recommendations": "next steps or additional considerations"
}

MEDICAL CONTEXT: This is for educational purposes. Always recommend professional medical consultation.

    createZeroShotPrompt() {
        return `
        Analyze this chest X-ray image for pneumonia detection.
        
        TASK: Determine if pneumonia is present in the provided chest X-ray image.
        
        ANALYSIS APPROACH:
        1. Systematically examine both lung fields
        2. Look for abnormal opacity, consolidation, or infiltrates
        3. Assess image quality and positioning
        4. Consider differential diagnoses
        
        RESPONSE FORMAT:
        - Diagnosis: Clear statement of findings
        - Confidence: Percentage indicating certainty
        - Key Findings: Specific radiological observations
        - Recommendation: Professional consultation advice
        
        IMPORTANT: This analysis is for educational purposes only. 
        Always consult qualified medical professionals for diagnosis.

### Test Case 1: Normal Chest X-ray
```javascript
const normalXrayResult = await detector.analyzeXray(normalXrayImage);
// Expected: "No pneumonia detected" with high confidence
```

### Test Case 2: Clear Pneumonia Case
```javascript
const pneumoniaXrayResult = await detector.analyzeXray(pneumoniaXrayImage);
// Expected: "Pneumonia detected" with appropriate confidence
```

### Test Case 3: Ambiguous Case
```javascript
const ambiguousXrayResult = await detector.analyzeXray(ambiguousXrayImage);
// Expected: Lower confidence, request for additional imaging
```
