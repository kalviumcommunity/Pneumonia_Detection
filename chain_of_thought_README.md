## 📊 Reasoning Analysis Output

### Sample Reasoning Chain

```
🔍 Technical Assessment (Step 1/8)
"I begin by evaluating this posteroanterior chest radiograph. The image quality 
is adequate with good penetration and proper patient positioning. No rotation or 
significant artifacts are present that would compromise interpretation..."

🫁 Lung Examination (Step 2/8)
"Examining the right lung systematically: The upper lobe appears clear with normal 
vascular markings. The middle lobe shows some increased opacity in the medial aspect. 
The lower lobe demonstrates..."

🔬 Pattern Analysis (Step 4/8)
"The patterns I identify include: consolidation in the right middle lobe, air 
bronchograms visible within the opacity, and increased density compared to normal 
lung parenchyma. These findings are consistent with..."

✅ Confidence Assessment (Step 8/8)
"Based on this systematic analysis, I conclude pneumonia is present with 94% 
confidence. My reasoning is strong because: the opacity patterns are consistent 
with inflammatory changes, the distribution matches typical pneumonia presentation..."
