# Multi-Shot (Few-Shot) Prompting Implementation for Pneumonia Detection

## Overview
This implementation demonstrates multi-shot (few-shot) prompting in the context of AI-powered pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. Multi-shot prompting provides the AI model with multiple diverse examples to learn comprehensive patterns and handle various clinical scenarios.

## What is Multi-Shot Prompting?

Multi-shot prompting, also known as few-shot prompting, is a technique where we provide the AI model with multiple examples (typically 3-5) of the desired task before asking it to perform the same task on new input. This approach enables the AI to learn from diverse patterns and handle edge cases more effectively.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Multiple Examples**: 3-5 carefully selected training cases
- **Pattern Diversity**: Examples covering different clinical scenarios
- **Comprehensive Learning**: AI learns from various pathological presentations
- **Robust Performance**: Better handling of edge cases and unusual presentations

## Multi-Shot Learning in Medical Context

### Why Multi-Shot Works Exceptionally Well for Medical AI:

1. **Clinical Diversity**: Medicine requires understanding of varied presentations
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple examples help identify subtle diagnostic patterns
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Covers unusual or atypical cases
4. **Confidence Calibration**: Learns appropriate uncertainty expression across scenarios
5. **Differential Diagnosis**: Understands how to distinguish between conditions

## Implementation Design

### Carefully Selected Training Examples

Our multi-shot implementation includes 4 diverse medical examples:

#### Example 1: Normal Chest X-ray
```
Patient: 28-year-old healthy adult, routine screening
Findings: Clear bilateral lung fields, normal heart size
Diagnosis: No pneumonia detected
Confidence: 95%
Teaching Point: Demonstrates normal radiological appearance
```

#### Example 2: Bacterial Pneumonia
```
Patient: 65-year-old with acute onset fever and productive cough
Findings: Dense consolidation in right middle lobe with air bronchograms
Diagnosis: Pneumonia detected - Bacterial pneumonia, right middle lobe
Confidence: 93%
Teaching Point: Classic bacterial pneumonia presentation
```

#### Example 3: Viral Pneumonia
```
Patient: 42-year-old with gradual onset of symptoms
Findings: Bilateral patchy infiltrates, interstitial pattern
Diagnosis: Pneumonia detected - Viral pneumonia, bilateral
Confidence: 87%
Teaching Point: Viral vs bacterial pneumonia differentiation
```

#### Example 4: Subtle/Early Pneumonia
```
Patient: 55-year-old immunocompromised with mild symptoms
Findings: Subtle increased opacity in left lower lobe
Diagnosis: Pneumonia detected - Early pneumonia, left lower lobe
Confidence: 78%
Teaching Point: Subtle findings and appropriate uncertainty
```

You are an expert radiologist specializing in chest X-ray interpretation. 
Study these diverse training examples to understand the full spectrum of pneumonia presentation:

=== TRAINING EXAMPLE 1: NORMAL CASE ===
Patient: 28-year-old, routine health screening
Clinical History: Asymptomatic, no respiratory complaints

SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS:
Technical: Good quality PA chest X-ray, adequate inspiration
Heart: Normal size (CTR <0.5), clear borders
Lungs: 
- Bilateral lung fields clear and well-expanded
- Normal bronchovascular markings
- No consolidation, infiltrates, or masses
- Sharp costophrenic angles bilaterally
Pleura: No effusion or pneumothorax

INTERPRETATION:
Primary Diagnosis: No pneumonia detected
Confidence: 95%
Pattern: Normal chest radiograph
Clinical Correlation: Normal findings consistent with healthy individual

=== TRAINING EXAMPLE 2: BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA ===
Patient: 65-year-old with acute fever (102Â°F), productive cough with purulent sputum
Clinical History: 3-day onset, chills, shortness of breath

SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS:
Technical: Adequate PA view, slight under-inspiration
Heart: Normal size and contours
Lungs:
- Right upper and middle lobes: Dense homogeneous consolidation
- Air bronchograms clearly visible within consolidation
- Left lung: Clear with normal vascular markings
- Sharp demarcation of consolidation boundaries
Pleura: No effusion, clear costophrenic angles

INTERPRETATION:
Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia detected - Bacterial pneumonia, right upper and middle lobes
Confidence: 93%
Pattern: Lobar consolidation with air bronchograms (classic bacterial pattern)
Clinical Correlation: Acute presentation with dense consolidation suggests bacterial etiology

=== TRAINING EXAMPLE 3: VIRAL PNEUMONIA ===
Patient: 42-year-old with gradual onset dry cough, low-grade fever
Clinical History: 7-day progressive symptoms, fatigue, minimal sputum

SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS:
Technical: Good quality study, proper positioning
Heart: Normal size and position
Lungs:
- Bilateral patchy infiltrates predominantly in lower lobes
- Interstitial pattern with reticular opacities
- No distinct consolidation or air bronchograms
- Perihilar distribution of opacities
Pleura: No effusion or pneumothorax

INTERPRETATION:
Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia detected - Viral pneumonia, bilateral lower lobes
Confidence: 87%
Pattern: Bilateral interstitial infiltrates (typical viral pattern)
Clinical Correlation: Gradual onset with bilateral interstitial pattern consistent with viral etiology

=== TRAINING EXAMPLE 4: SUBTLE/EARLY PNEUMONIA ===
Patient: 55-year-old immunocompromised (diabetes), mild cough
Clinical History: Recent onset subtle symptoms, no fever initially

SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS:
Technical: Good quality study
Heart: Mildly enlarged, stable from prior
Lungs:
- Subtle increased opacity in left lower lobe posterior segment
- Ill-defined borders, minimal consolidation
- Right lung clear with normal markings
- No definite air bronchograms
Pleura: No effusion detected

INTERPRETATION:
Primary Diagnosis: Pneumonia detected - Early/subtle pneumonia, left lower lobe
Confidence: 78%
Pattern: Subtle opacity in immunocompromised patient
Clinical Correlation: Early pneumonia in immunocompromised patient; clinical correlation essential
