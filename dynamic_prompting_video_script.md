# Dynamic Prompting Video Script
## Pneumonia Detection AI Educational Series

---

### 🎬 **SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION (0:00 - 0:30)**

**[VISUAL: Dynamic title animation showing AI adapting its approach based on different patient scenarios]**

**NARRATOR:** "Welcome back to our AI Medical Series! Today we're exploring Dynamic Prompting - the revolutionary technique that makes AI truly intelligent by adapting its behavior based on what it discovers."

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing static vs. dynamic AI responses]**

**PRESENTER:** "Unlike static prompts that never change, dynamic prompting creates AI that thinks and adapts like a real doctor - modifying its approach based on initial findings, patient characteristics, and clinical context."

---

### 🎬 **SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM WITH STATIC AI (0:30 - 1:15)**

**[VISUAL: Animation showing a robot following the same script regardless of different patient scenarios]**

**PRESENTER:** "Traditional AI uses the same approach for every case. Whether it's a 5-year-old with mild symptoms or an 80-year-old emergency patient, the AI asks the same questions and follows the same analytical path."

**[VISUAL: Medical scenarios showing how different patients need different approaches]**

**PRESENTER:** "But real medicine doesn't work this way. A pediatric case requires different considerations than a geriatric patient. An emergency presentation needs rapid assessment, while a routine screening allows for comprehensive evaluation."

**[VISUAL: Frustrated doctor trying to use one-size-fits-all approach]**

**PRESENTER:** "This is where dynamic prompting changes everything - creating AI that adapts like an experienced physician."

---

### 🎬 **SCENE 3: DYNAMIC PROMPTING CONCEPT (1:15 - 2:30)**

**[VISUAL: Intelligent AI brain that morphs and adapts based on different inputs]**

**PRESENTER:** "Dynamic prompting creates AI that performs multi-step analysis:

**Step 1:** Initial assessment with patient context integration
**Step 2:** Complexity detection and risk stratification  
**Step 3:** Adaptive pathway selection
**Step 4:** Specialized follow-up analysis"

**[VISUAL: Flowchart showing decision tree with multiple pathways]**

**PRESENTER:** "The AI doesn't just analyze - it THINKS. Based on what it finds initially, it chooses the most appropriate follow-up approach:

- **Normal findings** → Enhanced scrutiny for subtle changes
- **Obvious pathology** → Detailed complication assessment
- **Ambiguous findings** → Uncertainty resolution protocols
- **Pediatric patient** → Age-specific analysis
- **Emergency case** → Rapid assessment prioritization"

**[VISUAL: Each pathway lighting up as different scenarios are mentioned]**

### 🎬 **SCENE 4: PATIENT CONTEXT INTEGRATION (2:30 - 3:15)**

**[VISUAL: Patient information flowing into AI system and transforming the analysis approach]**

**PRESENTER:** "Dynamic prompting excels at context integration. Watch how patient information transforms the AI's approach:"

**[VISUAL: Form being filled out with patient details]**

**PRESENTER:** "Age: 65 years → Geriatric-specific considerations
Medical History: Immunocompromised → Enhanced sensitivity protocols
Symptoms: Acute onset → Bacterial pneumonia focus
Setting: Emergency department → Rapid assessment priority"

**[VISUAL: AI analysis adapting in real-time as each parameter is added]**

**PRESENTER:** "Each piece of context information doesn't just inform the diagnosis - it fundamentally changes HOW the AI analyzes the image."

---

### 🎬 **SCENE 5: LIVE DEMONSTRATION (3:15 - 5:30)**

**[VISUAL: Screen recording of the dynamic prompting application]**

**PRESENTER:** "Let me demonstrate this with a real case. I'll upload a chest X-ray and show you how dynamic adaptation works."

**[VISUAL: Filling out patient context form]**

**PRESENTER:** "First, I'm providing patient context:
- Age: 72 years (Elderly)
- Symptoms: Acute onset dyspnea
- Medical History: COPD
- Setting: Emergency department"

**[VISUAL: Context summary appearing]**

**PRESENTER:** "Notice how the AI immediately recognizes this as a high-risk, complex case requiring specialized geriatric emergency protocols."

**[VISUAL: Uploading chest X-ray]**

**PRESENTER:** "Now I upload the X-ray. Watch the dynamic analysis process:"

**[VISUAL: Loading screen showing analysis steps]**

**PRESENTER:** "Step 1: Initial Assessment - The AI quickly identifies bilateral infiltrates
Step 2: Complexity Detection - Recognizes this as a complex case requiring detailed follow-up
Step 3: Adaptive Selection - Chooses emergency geriatric protocols
Step 4: Specialized Analysis - Performs elderly-specific assessment with COPD considerations"

**[VISUAL: Results appearing with multiple analysis steps]**

### 🎬 **SCENE 6: ANALYSIS BREAKDOWN (5:30 - 6:45)**

**[VISUAL: Close-up of the dynamic analysis results showing multiple steps]**

**PRESENTER:** "Look at these results - this isn't just one analysis, it's an intelligent conversation between AI and clinical context."

**[VISUAL: Highlighting Step 1 - Initial Assessment]**

**PRESENTER:** "Initial Assessment identified bilateral infiltrates with 85% confidence, complexity level: High, requiring specialized follow-up."

**[VISUAL: Highlighting Step 2 - Follow-up Analysis]**

**PRESENTER:** "The AI then automatically selected 'Emergency Elderly Analysis' and performed:
- COPD vs. pneumonia differentiation
- Exacerbation severity assessment
- Hospitalization criteria evaluation
- Elderly-specific treatment considerations"

**[VISUAL: Patient Context Integration section]**

**PRESENTER:** "Notice how patient context directly influenced the analysis:
- Age-appropriate geriatric protocols
- COPD background consideration
- Emergency timeline prioritization
- Risk stratification for elderly patient"

---

### 🎬 **SCENE 7: ADAPTATION INSIGHTS (6:45 - 7:30)**

**[VISUAL: Dynamic adaptation insights section highlighted]**

**PRESENTER:** "The 'Dynamic Adaptation Insights' show exactly how the AI modified its behavior:

1. **Selected Emergency Follow-up** based on clinical setting
2. **Applied Geriatric-specific criteria** due to patient age  
3. **Prioritized rapid assessment** for emergency presentation
4. **Integrated COPD considerations** from medical history"

**[VISUAL: Comparison showing what analysis would look like without dynamic adaptation]**

**PRESENTER:** "Compare this to static analysis - same image, but generic approach without patient-specific adaptations. The difference in clinical relevance is dramatic!"

---

### 🎬 **SCENE 8: CLINICAL SCENARIOS (7:30 - 8:15)**

**[VISUAL: Multiple patient scenarios showing different dynamic adaptations]**

**PRESENTER:** "Dynamic prompting handles diverse scenarios intelligently:

**Pediatric Case:** 5-year-old with cough
- Adapts to age-appropriate normal patterns
- Considers viral pneumonia predominance
- Applies pediatric hospitalization criteria

**Immunocompromised Patient:** Cancer patient on chemotherapy  
- Heightened sensitivity for opportunistic infections
- Lower threshold for intervention
- Atypical presentation awareness

**Emergency Case:** Acute dyspnea and hypoxia
- Prioritizes life-threatening conditions
- Rapid severity assessment
- Immediate intervention focus"

**[VISUAL: Each scenario showing different analysis pathways]**

### 🎬 **SCENE 9: RTFC FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION (8:15 - 9:00)**

**[VISUAL: RTFC framework elements being dynamically applied]**

**PRESENTER:** "Dynamic prompting perfectly embodies the RTFC framework:

**ROLE:** The AI's role adapts - from general radiologist to pediatric specialist to emergency physician based on context

**TASK:** Tasks evolve - from routine screening to urgent assessment to specialized analysis

**FORMAT:** Output format adapts - brief for normal findings, comprehensive for complex pathology

**CONTEXT:** Context continuously integrates - patient demographics, clinical presentation, and progressive findings"

**[VISUAL: Framework elements morphing and adapting]**

**PRESENTER:** "This creates truly intelligent AI that doesn't just respond - it thinks, adapts, and provides clinically relevant analysis."

### 🎬 **SCENE 10: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION (9:00 - 9:30)**

**[VISUAL: Code snippets showing dynamic prompt templates]**

**PRESENTER:** "Technically, we implement this through:

- **Multiple Prompt Templates** for different scenarios
- **Conditional Logic** based on initial findings
- **Context Integration** throughout the analysis
- **Progressive Refinement** with each step"

**[VISUAL: API calls showing adaptive temperature and token usage]**
