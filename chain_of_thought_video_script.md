## **[INTRO - 0:00-0:30]**

**[Visual: Animation showing a doctor thinking through a diagnosis step-by-step]**

**Narrator:** "Welcome to our series on advanced prompt engineering! Today we're exploring **Chain of Thought Prompting** - a revolutionary technique that makes AI show its reasoning process, just like a doctor explaining their diagnostic thinking."

**[Visual: Side-by-side comparison of "black box" AI vs transparent reasoning]**

**Narrator:** "Instead of getting a mysterious 'yes or no' answer, Chain of Thought prompting reveals every step of the AI's thought process, making it transparent, trustworthy, and educational."

## **[PROBLEM STATEMENT - 0:30-1:15]**

**[Visual: Medical consultation scene with confused patient]**

**Narrator:** "Imagine asking an AI: 'Does this X-ray show pneumonia?' and getting just 'Yes, 95% confidence.' That's helpful, but..."

**[Visual: Question marks appearing]**

**Narrator:** "**How did it reach that conclusion?** What patterns did it see? Could there be alternative diagnoses? For medical AI, this transparency isn't just nice-to-have—it's **essential for safety and trust.**"

**[Visual: Chain of Thought diagram appearing]**

**Narrator:** "Chain of Thought prompting solves this by making AI **think out loud**, showing its step-by-step reasoning process. Let's see how this transforms pneumonia detection."

## **[WHAT IS CHAIN OF THOUGHT? - 1:15-2:30]**

**[Visual: Animated brain with thought bubbles showing reasoning steps]**

**Narrator:** "Chain of Thought prompting is inspired by how humans solve complex problems. Instead of jumping to conclusions, we think step-by-step:"

**[Visual: Doctor examining X-ray with thought process shown]**

**Doctor Voiceover:** 
- "First, I check the image quality..."
- "Then I examine each lung field systematically..."
- "I look for specific patterns..."
- "I consider alternative diagnoses..."
- "Finally, I weigh the evidence..."

**[Visual: AI mimicking this process]**

**Narrator:** "Chain of Thought prompting teaches AI to follow this same systematic approach, making every decision **auditable and explainable**."

## **[THE RTFC FRAMEWORK IN ACTION - 2:30-4:00]**

**[Visual: RTFC framework diagram]**

**Narrator:** "Let's see how I applied the RTFC Framework to create our Chain of Thought prompting system:"

### **ROLE Definition**
**[Visual: Medical expert avatar]**

**Narrator:** "**Role**: 'You are an expert radiologist with 15 years of experience...' This establishes the AI's expertise and perspective."

### **TASK Specification**
**[Visual: Systematic examination checklist]**

**Narrator:** "**Task**: Instead of just 'analyze this image,' I specified: 'Perform a systematic 8-step analysis, showing your reasoning at each stage.'"

**[Visual: 8-step process visualization]**

**Steps shown:**
1. Technical Assessment
2. Lung Examination
3. Cardiac Assessment
4. Pattern Analysis
5. Differential Diagnosis
6. Evidence Weighing
7. Final Reasoning
8. Confidence Assessment

### **FORMAT Requirements**
**[Visual: Structured output template]**

**Narrator:** "**Format**: I required structured reasoning with specific sections for each step, making the thought process easy to follow and analyze."

### **CONTEXT Provision**
**[Visual: Medical safety protocols]**

**Narrator:** "**Context**: I included medical safety protocols, reasoning quality standards, and educational objectives to ensure responsible AI behavior."

## **[LIVE DEMONSTRATION - 4:00-6:30]**

**[Visual: Screen recording of the application]**

**Narrator:** "Now let's see Chain of Thought prompting in action. I'll upload a chest X-ray and watch the AI think through its diagnosis step-by-step."

**[Visual: Uploading an X-ray image]**

**Narrator:** "As the AI analyzes this image, notice how it doesn't jump to conclusions. Instead, it follows a systematic reasoning chain..."

**[Visual: Reasoning steps appearing one by one]**

**AI Reasoning (displayed on screen):**

**Step 1 - Technical Assessment:**
"I begin by evaluating this posteroanterior chest radiograph. The image quality is adequate with good penetration and proper patient positioning. No rotation or significant artifacts are present that would compromise interpretation..."

**Step 2 - Systematic Lung Examination:**
"Examining the right lung: The upper lobe appears clear with normal vascular markings. The middle lobe shows some increased opacity in the medial aspect. The lower lobe demonstrates..."

**[Visual: Highlighting different areas as AI describes them]**

**Narrator:** "See how the AI systematically examines each area? This mirrors exactly how expert radiologists approach image interpretation."

**[Continue showing steps 3-8 with key highlights]**

**Final Step - Confidence Assessment:**
"Based on this systematic analysis, I conclude pneumonia is present with 94% confidence. My reasoning is strong because: the opacity patterns are consistent with inflammatory changes, the distribution matches typical pneumonia presentation, and alternative diagnoses are less likely given the specific pattern characteristics."

## **[EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS - 6:30-7:30]**

**[Visual: Split screen showing traditional AI vs Chain of Thought]**

**Narrator:** "Compare this transparent process with traditional AI that simply outputs 'Pneumonia detected: 94% confidence.' The difference is remarkable:"

**[Visual: Checklist with benefits]**

**Benefits shown:**
- ✅ **Transparency**: Every decision is explained
- ✅ **Educational**: Shows proper diagnostic reasoning
- ✅ **Trustworthy**: Reasoning can be validated
