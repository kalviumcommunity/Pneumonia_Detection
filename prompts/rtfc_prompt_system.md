## User Prompt Templates

### Template 1: Zero-Shot Analysis
```
# USER PROMPT - ZERO-SHOT ANALYSIS

## TASK (T)
Analyze this chest X-ray image to determine if pneumonia is present. Provide a comprehensive diagnostic assessment following medical imaging standards.

## CONTEXT (C)
- Patient age: [if available]
- Clinical symptoms: [if available] 
- Previous medical history: [if relevant]
- Urgency level: [routine/urgent/emergency]

## FORMAT (F)
Please provide your analysis in the structured JSON format as specified in the system prompt, ensuring all required fields are populated with relevant findings.

## ROLE REMINDER (R)
Approach this as an expert radiologist would, considering all visible pathological indicators while maintaining appropriate medical caution.
```

### Template 2: Few-Shot Learning Analysis
```
# USER PROMPT - FEW-SHOT LEARNING ANALYSIS

## CONTEXT (C)
Here are examples of pneumonia detection patterns to guide your analysis:

**Example 1 - Normal Chest X-ray:**
- Clear, dark lung fields bilaterally
- Visible bronchial markings without consolidation
- Normal cardiac silhouette
- No pleural effusion or infiltrates

**Example 2 - Bacterial Pneumonia:**
- Dense consolidation in right lower lobe
- Air bronchograms visible within consolidation
- Well-defined borders
- Unilateral presentation

**Example 3 - Viral Pneumonia:**
- Bilateral patchy infiltrates
- Diffuse pattern across multiple lobes
- Less dense than bacterial pneumonia
- Interstitial involvement

## TASK (T)
Using these reference patterns, analyze the provided chest X-ray image and determine:
1. Presence or absence of pneumonia
2. If present, classify the likely type (bacterial/viral/other)
3. Assess severity and extent
4. Compare findings to the reference examples

## FORMAT (F)
Provide analysis in the structured JSON format, with additional comparison notes in the "educational_insights" section relating your findings to the provided examples.

## ROLE (R)
Act as a teaching radiologist, explaining how the current image compares to the educational examples while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.
```

### Template 3: Chain-of-Thought Analysis
```
# USER PROMPT - CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT ANALYSIS

## TASK (T)
Perform a systematic, step-by-step analysis of this chest X-ray image following this diagnostic reasoning chain:

### Step 1: Technical Assessment
- Evaluate image quality, positioning, and adequacy
- Identify any technical artifacts or limitations

### Step 2: Systematic Review
- Examine lung fields systematically (upper → middle → lower zones)
- Assess cardiac silhouette and mediastinal structures
- Evaluate pleural spaces and diaphragm

### Step 3: Pattern Recognition
- Identify any areas of opacity, consolidation, or abnormal shadowing
- Assess for air bronchograms, infiltrates, or effusions
- Compare bilateral symmetry

### Step 4: Clinical Correlation
- Consider pneumonia-specific indicators
- Evaluate distribution patterns (lobar, bronchial, interstitial)
- Assess severity and extent

### Step 5: Differential Diagnosis
- Rule out other pathologies
- Consider alternative diagnoses
- Assess confidence level

### Step 6: Final Assessment
- Synthesize findings into primary diagnosis
- Assign confidence score
- Recommend follow-up actions

## FORMAT (F)
Document each step clearly in the JSON format, with detailed explanations in the "educational_insights" section showing your reasoning process.

## CONTEXT (C)
This systematic approach ensures no findings are missed and provides educational value for understanding radiological interpretation methodology.

## ROLE (R)
Function as a mentor radiologist teaching the diagnostic process, explaining each decision point and reasoning step.
```

### Template 4: Dynamic Adaptive Analysis
```
# USER PROMPT - DYNAMIC ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS

## ROLE (R)

2. Choose between focused evaluation (for obvious findings) or comprehensive screening (for subtle findings)
3. Adapt your confidence thresholds based on image quality and clarity
4. Provide reasoning for your chosen analytical approach

## CONTEXT (C)
Consider these factors when adapting your approach:
- Image quality and technical adequacy
- Clarity of potential pathological findings
