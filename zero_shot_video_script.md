## Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Zero-shot demo page with title]**

"Hello! Today I'm going to demonstrate zero-shot prompting in the context of AI-powered pneumonia detection. Zero-shot prompting is a powerful technique that allows AI models to perform complex tasks without any specific examples or training data for that particular task."

**[Screen: Definition graphic of zero-shot prompting]**

"This approach is particularly valuable in medical AI where we want the model to rely on its broad medical knowledge rather than specific examples."

## What is Zero-Shot Prompting? (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Comparison showing traditional vs zero-shot approach]**

"Let me explain what makes zero-shot prompting special. In traditional approaches, we might show the AI several examples of pneumonia X-rays with their diagnoses. But with zero-shot prompting, we provide NO examples at all."

**[Screen: Code showing zero-shot prompt]**

"Instead, we give the AI:
1. A clear task description
2. Specific requirements for analysis  
3. The format we want for the response
4. Medical context and safety guidelines

Here's our zero-shot prompt structure:

```
Analyze this chest X-ray image for signs of pneumonia.

TASK: You are a radiologist examining a chest X-ray. 
Determine if pneumonia is present based on your medical knowledge.

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Systematically examine both lung fields
2. Look for abnormal opacity, consolidation, or infiltrates
3. Assess for signs of inflammation or infection
...
```

Notice how we don't provide any example X-rays or diagnoses. The AI must rely entirely on its pre-trained medical knowledge."

## Implementation Demonstration (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Live demo of uploading an X-ray image]**

"Let me show you how this works in practice. I'll upload a chest X-ray image and run our zero-shot analysis."

**[Screen: File upload and image preview]**

"First, I select a chest X-ray image. Our system validates the file type and size, then displays a preview."

**[Screen: Clicking analyze button]**

"Now I'll click 'Perform Zero-Shot Analysis.' Watch what happens - the AI receives only our prompt and the image, with no examples to guide it."

**[Screen: Loading screen with explanation]**

"During processing, the AI uses its pre-trained medical knowledge to:
- Understand the task requirements
- Apply its knowledge of chest X-ray interpretation
- Generate a structured medical assessment
- Follow our specified output format"

**[Screen: Results display]**

"And here are the results! Notice how the AI provides:
- A clear diagnosis with confidence score
- Detailed clinical reasoning
- Specific radiological findings
- Professional recommendations
- Token usage logging for transparency"

**[Screen: Console showing token count]**

"You can see in the console that this analysis used X tokens, which is logged automatically for monitoring API usage."

## Zero-Shot vs Other Approaches (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Comparison table or graphics]**

"Zero-shot prompting has unique advantages:

**Simplicity**: No need to curate example datasets
**Speed**: Immediate deployment without example preparation  
**Flexibility**: Can be applied to new medical imaging tasks instantly
**Efficiency**: Lower token usage since we don't include examples

However, there are trade-offs:
**Consistency**: May be less predictable than few-shot approaches
**Specificity**: Requires very precise instructions
**Validation**: Needs thorough testing for medical safety"

## Key Benefits in Medical AI (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Medical AI benefits visualization]**

"For medical applications, zero-shot prompting is particularly valuable because:

1. **Broad Medical Knowledge**: Leverages the model's extensive pre-training on medical literature
2. **No Bias from Examples**: Doesn't limit the AI to specific example patterns
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Allows quick testing of new diagnostic approaches
4. **Educational Value**: Demonstrates how AI applies general medical knowledge"

## Code Implementation Highlights (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Code editor showing key functions]**

"Let's look at the key implementation details:

Our zero-shot prompt is completely self-contained:
```javascript
this.zeroShotPrompt = `
Analyze this chest X-ray image for signs of pneumonia.
TASK: You are a radiologist examining a chest X-ray...
`
```

The API call is straightforward - just the prompt and image:
```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
    contents: [{
        parts: [
            { text: this.zeroShotPrompt },
            { inline_data: { mime_type: this.currentImage.type, data: base64Image }}
        ]
    }]
})
```

And we parse the structured response to extract medical findings:
```javascript
const diagnosis = this.extractField(responseText, 'DIAGNOSIS');
const confidence = this.extractField(responseText, 'CONFIDENCE');
```

Notice how we log token usage to the console after every API call - this helps monitor costs and performance."

## Results Analysis (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Example results with annotations]**

"The zero-shot approach produces structured, professional medical assessments. The AI demonstrates understanding of:
- Radiological terminology
- Systematic examination procedures  
- Confidence assessment
- Medical ethics and disclaimers

This shows the power of well-designed zero-shot prompts in specialized domains like medical imaging."

## Conclusion (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Summary and GitHub repository]**

"Zero-shot prompting proves that with clear instructions and proper structure, AI models can perform complex medical tasks using only their pre-trained knowledge. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility, and immediate applicability - making it perfect for rapid prototyping and educational applications in medical AI.

The complete implementation is available in our GitHub repository. Thank you for watching!"
