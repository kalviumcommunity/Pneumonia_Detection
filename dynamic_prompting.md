# Dynamic Prompting Implementation
## Pneumonia Detection AI System

### üéØ **Overview**
Dynamic prompting represents an advanced AI technique where prompts adapt and evolve based on initial findings, user input, or contextual information. Unlike static prompts that remain fixed, dynamic prompts modify their behavior, questions, and analysis depth based on real-time assessment of the situation.

### üß† **Concept Explanation**

#### **What is Dynamic Prompting?**
Dynamic prompting is an intelligent prompting strategy where:
- **Adaptive Behavior**: The AI adjusts its approach based on initial analysis
- **Contextual Awareness**: Prompts change based on patient history, symptoms, or image characteristics
- **Progressive Investigation**: The AI asks follow-up questions or requests additional information
- **Conditional Logic**: Different analytical paths based on preliminary findings

#### **Medical Relevance**
In medical practice, dynamic prompting mirrors:
- **Clinical Decision Trees**: Doctors adjust their examination based on initial findings
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Investigation narrows based on initial observations
- **Progressive Assessment**: Additional tests requested based on preliminary results
- **Adaptive Questioning**: Patient interviews adapt based on initial symptoms

### üè• **Implementation Strategy for Pneumonia Detection**

#### **Dynamic Analysis Workflow**
1. **Initial Assessment**: Quick preliminary scan for obvious findings
2. **Adaptive Depth**: Adjust analysis depth based on complexity
3. **Conditional Questioning**: Ask relevant follow-up questions
4. **Progressive Refinement**: Refine diagnosis based on additional information
5. **Contextual Recommendations**: Tailor recommendations to specific findings

#### **Dynamic Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Normal Initial Finding**
```
Initial Assessment: "Clear lung fields detected"
‚Üì
Dynamic Response: "Performing detailed assessment for subtle findings"
‚Üì
Follow-up: "Checking for minimal infiltrates or early changes"
```

**Scenario 2: Obvious Pathology**
```
Initial Assessment: "Dense consolidation visible"
‚Üì
Dynamic Response: "Analyzing consolidation pattern and distribution"
‚Üì
Follow-up: "Evaluating for complications and severity assessment"
```

**Scenario 3: Ambiguous Findings**
```
Initial Assessment: "Questionable opacity detected"
‚Üì
Dynamic Response: "Requesting additional clinical information"
‚Üì
Follow-up: "Correlating with symptoms, lab values, and history"
```
