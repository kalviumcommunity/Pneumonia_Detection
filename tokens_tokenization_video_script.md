---

## SCENE 1: INTRODUCTION (0:00 - 0:30)

**[VISUAL: Animated title card with token symbols floating around a medical AI interface]**

**NARRATOR:** "Welcome to our deep dive into tokens and tokenization - the fundamental building blocks that determine the cost and efficiency of every AI-powered medical analysis."

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing a medical report and colorful token visualization]**

**NARRATOR:** "Whether you're analyzing chest X-rays, processing medical reports, or building AI diagnostic tools, understanding tokenization is crucial for both performance and cost optimization."

---

## SCENE 2: WHAT ARE TOKENS? (0:30 - 1:15)

**[VISUAL: Animation showing text being broken down into colorful token pieces]**

**NARRATOR:** "Tokens are the basic units that AI models process. Think of them as the 'words' that AI speaks, but they're not always actual words."

**[VISUAL: Examples showing different token types with highlighting]**
- "pneumonia" → [pneumon][ia] (2 tokens)
- "chest" → [chest] (1 token) 
- "X-ray" → [X][-][ray] (3 tokens)
- "101.5°F" → [101][.][5][°][F] (5 tokens)

**NARRATOR:** "Medical terminology often uses more tokens than regular words because of complex spellings and specialized vocabulary. This directly impacts your AI costs."

---

## SCENE 3: WHY TOKENS MATTER IN MEDICAL AI (1:15 - 2:00)

**[VISUAL: Cost calculator showing real numbers]**

**NARRATOR:** "Every token costs money. For a typical chest X-ray analysis:"

**[VISUAL: Animated cost breakdown]**
- Input prompt: 500 tokens = $0.75
- AI response: 800 tokens = $1.60
- Total per analysis: $2.35

**NARRATOR:** "Multiply by 1000 analyses per month, and you're spending $2,350. But with smart tokenization, we can reduce this by 30-60%."

**[VISUAL: Split comparison showing optimized vs unoptimized costs]**

2. **Technical measurements:** "posteroanterior" = 6 tokens vs "PA" = 1 token
3. **Complex descriptions:** Full diagnostic text vs structured templates

**NARRATOR:** "These challenges mean medical AI applications often use 50% more tokens than general text processing."
